Create api
1. use `mix phx.gen.json [context name] [module name] [schema table name] [columename:type...]`
2. use `mix ecto.create` create database with config in config/dev.exs and stuct filed with settings in lib/[project name]/[module name]/[schema table name].ex
3. use `mix ecto.gen.migration [user_input]` generate a migration file for log the database migrations in sequence
4. edit databse change in priv/repo/migrations/date_user_input.exs
5. use `mix ecto.migrate` to migrate the database

Test api
1. list all posts -> GET
curl -i GET http://localhost:4000/api/posts
2. create a post -> POST
curl -iX POST http://localhost:4000/api/posts \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{"data": {
        "tag": "tag",
        "title": "title",
        "category": "category",
        "content": "content",
        "description": "description"
    }}'
3. read a post -> GET
curl -i GET http://localhost:4000/api/posts/id
4. update a post -> PUT
curl -iX PUT http://localhost:4000/api/posts/id \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

curl -iX DELETE http://localhost:4000/api/posts/id \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'


curl -i http://localhost:4000/api/posts -> list all posts
curl -i http://localhost:4000/api/posts/id -> list id-th post

login to database and check the created result
sh: psql -U postgres -> passward:postgres

    "category": "World News",
    "content": "The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new report on June 3, 2025, warning that polar ice melt is accelerating faster than previously predicted. The report, compiled by over 300 scientists worldwide, cites record-breaking temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic regions over the past year. According to the findings, global sea levels could rise by up to 1.2 meters by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically cut within the next decade. The report also highlights the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and wildfires. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres called the findings a red alert for humanity and urged world leaders to commit to binding emission reduction targets ahead of the COP30 summit in Brazil later this year. Environmental groups welcomed the report but expressed concern over the slow pace of international action. The report stresses that immediate investment in renewable energy, forest preservation, and climate adaptation strategies are essential to avoid catastrophic consequences.",
